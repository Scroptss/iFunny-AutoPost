	Install from the link below and make sure to click "Add to PATH" when installing.

	https://www.python.org/downloads/



Instructions:
	
	First we need to install the required modules, to do this we will open the folder, and copy the directory. (E.G: C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\AutoPost )
	
	Open command prompt and type: cd (directory you copied)
	now copy and paste: pip install -r requirements.txt

	Python should start downloading the required modules listed in the text file.

	Once it is finished, edit the config.env file and input your email and password in the appropriate fields.
